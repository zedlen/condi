# About the diagrams

For managing diagrams and keep them updated if needed, all diagrams are inline the md files, there are also a specific folder called `mermaid` where you can find each diagram separately. When updating the diagram in any document please remember to update the one in its own file.

### TODO

- [ ] Insert diagram images instead of inline code.
- [ ] Create a script that helps to create and image of all diagrams and save them in a `images` folder.
